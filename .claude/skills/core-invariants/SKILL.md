# Core Invariants

Use when a change risks architectural drift. Enforce: the project runtime directory is SSoT; clear subsystem ownership; consistent schemas; atomic operations; idempotent retries; no silent fallback. Report violations and concrete repair steps.

## Passive Loading Rule

Do not preload this skill during startup, hot reload, or background indexing. Read it only when the user request directly matches this workflow.

## Minimal Procedure

1. Confirm the target result and affected LUX subsystem.
2. Read only the files or evidence needed for the decision.
3. Apply the checklist above without expanding scope.
4. Produce concise output with evidence, risks, and the next verified action.

## Output

- Result or verdict.
- Evidence used.
- Risks or blockers.
- Verification performed or the smallest remaining check.
